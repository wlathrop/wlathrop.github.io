This is my first technical blog (hopefully one of many) on my path to becoming a software developer. This first post is in reagrds to why I decided to learn software development. 

I've always loved computers and have always wanted to learn how computers think. I got introduced to computers at an early age for a 80's baby.  Some of my earlierst memories involve launching a terminal in MS-DOS to boot up "The Secret of Monkey Island" or "Oregon Trail". 

For the past decade I have been a studying and practicing Physical Therapist. Apart from direct patient care another key component of a Physical Therapists daily job is documentation. Thankfully all my documentation has been via electronic medial record documentation as oppopsed to pen and paper. The downside to electronic documentation is that all the programs out there, whether it be the big players like Epic and Cerner or smaller companies like Casamba, their software is all focused on nursing documentation rather than rehabilitation. 

Right now, a typical Physical Therapists day consists of 55-65% direct patient care and 45-35% documentation. The current electronic medical record (EMR) programs are clunky and require excess effort to get the type of detail and data required for an effective PT daily progress note or PT evaluation. So even if I can only help to reduce that documanetation time by 10% overall, that could mean the difference between an patient in an hospital being seen or not seen that day 

So my end goal for my time here at FlatIron and as a perspective software developer/programmer would be to aide some of the aforementioned compaies (or even start my own) to better meet the needs of  Physical Therapists and other rehabilitation therapies by delivering a better, more efficent, and more user friendly program.
